**01/23/25.** 0-welcome. These slides give an overview of the course and
the software we will be using.

**01/28/25.** 1-R-vs-Python. These slides compare and contrast R and
Python and includes a few coding exercises.

**01/30/25.** Lab 1: Introduction to Git for Version Control.

**02/04/25.** 3-R-Python-datasci. These slides compare and contrast R
and Python for manipulating datasets and includes a few coding
exercises.

**02/06/25.** Lab 2: R, Python, and Git, Oh My!

**02/11/25.** 5-datavis-R. These slides discuss how you can create data
visualizations in R. We also started Lab 3: Data Visualization in R and
Python.

**02/13/25.** 6-datavis-py. These slides discuss how you can create data
visualizations in Python. We also continued working on Lab 3: Data
Visualization in R and Python.

**02/18/25**. 7-webscraping-R. These slides discuss how to web scrape in
R and how to write functions in R. We also started working on Lab 4: Web
Scraping in R.

**02/20/25.** 8-webscraping-R-py. These slides discuss how to web scrape
in both R and Python at a larger scale. We continued working on Lab 4:
Web Scraping in R.

**02/25/25.** 9-intro-machine-learning. These slides introduce machine
learning by discussing supervised & unsupervised learning, regression,
and classification.

**02/27/25.** 10-eval-models. These slides discuss how one can evaluate
a model by thinking about mean square error, bias, and variance.

**03/04/25.** 11-datasci-ethics. These slides discuss data ethics and
things to consider when pursuing your own data science projects.

**03/06/25.** Project work day.

**03/25/25.** 13-lin-reg. These slides discuss linear regression and how
to implement it in Python.

**03/27/25.** 14-lasso-ridge and 13-lasso-ridge-code. These slides
discuss ridge and lasso regression and how to implement these methods in
Python and R.

**04/01/25.** 15-logistic. These slides discuss logistic regression and
how to implement it in Python.

random forests and how to implement them in Python.

**04/15/25.** 19-unsupervised-PCA. These slides introduce unsupervised
learning and give a brief overview of principal component analysis
(PCA). I also talked about how I use unsupervised learning in my
research.
