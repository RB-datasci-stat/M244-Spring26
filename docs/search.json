As we will be using Python for the machine learning components, I suggest that you download the Python version.\nPlease note that the pdf version of this textbook is free! There is no need to purchase a hard copy unless you want to.\nFor other topics, there will be readings posted to Moodle/Google Drive."

    "section": "Software",
    "text": "Software\nThere are software requirements for the course. I highly recommend installing RStudio, R, Python, and Git to your personal computer. This is a very useful skill. However, I do not want this to be an obstacle for learning class material. Accessing these softwares through a server and web browser is also acceptable. See below for more details on each one.\n\nR\nWe will use R and RStudio throughout this course. You may access both of these resources on the Vassar College server:\n\nFor on campus: http://rstudio.vassar.edu/\nFor off campus: https://libproxy.vassar.edu/login?url=https://rstudio.vassar.edu.\n\nAlternatively (and recommended), you can download and install R on your computer at http://cran.r-project.org/, as well as RStudio which is available at https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. Please follow the instructions for downloading both here: https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html#installing (although note that since RStudio has become Posit, the steps for installing RStudio may be slightly different).\n\nReading More About R\nIf you want to brush up on your R skills, R for Data Science (2e) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund is an excellent introduction to the tidyverse approach to R programming.\nIf you are interested in R as a programming language, feel free to check out Hadley Wickham’s1 excellent Advanced R. You can access its contents for free online here: https://adv-r.hadley.nz/.\n\n\n\nPython\nWe will be using Python for the machine learning components of the course. You should also install Python and Jupyter Notebook on your computer. There are many ways to do this. One way is to install the Anaconda distribution of Python; it collects a wide array of useful packages, libraries, and applications that make it possible to use Python on your own computer. You can install from https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution. See https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html for helpful instructions for different platforms.\n\nReading More About Python\nThere are many books written about Python. In particular, Python for Everybody by Charles R. Severance is a great resource for those learning to use Python for data science, and A Whirlwind Tour of Python by Jake VanderPlas is a great introduction to Python in general; it serves as a necessary prerequisite to his Python Data Science Handbook.\n\n\n\nGit\nYou also need to install Git. Please follow the instructions at this link to do so: http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/accessing-the-terminal-and-installing-git.html. A helpful resource for using Git is the ProGit online book.\nYou will also need to make a Github account, if you have not done so. Please see here for instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account.\nWe will set-up Git together during the first lab so there is no need to do it before then."

Course communication will otherwise occur via our M 244 Slack workspace. In particular, I ask that you please not email me with course-related questions, but rather post these questions in the appropriate Slack channel. If discretion is needed, please feel free to direct message me on Slack.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. However, if you message me over the weekend or holidays, I may not respond to your message until classes resume in an effort to maintain my own work-life balance. Please plan accordingly."

    "text": "Assignments and Evaluation\n\nParticipation (15%)\nPlease come to class ready to discuss and engage with the course material! A great way to do this is to complete the reading we will cover in class beforehand.\nAttending class and arriving on time is required. You are allowed two unexcused absences and/or tardies. Each additional absence or tardiness will reduce your engagement grade by 5%. If you are unable to attend class (or need to arrive late) due to a family emergency, illness, religious holiday, etc., then please let me know as soon as possible so I can mark it as an excused absence. You do not need to tell me details of the situation, I will trust your word.\nLimited screen policy. Engaging with unrelated content on a laptop, tablet, and/or phone during class time is a distraction for both you and others. I ask that you only use your technological devices to enhance your learning (e.g., writing notes on a tablet) or when they are needed during class.\n\n\nLabs (Part of Participation Grade)\nA large portion of class time will be devoted to working through labs and tutorials. You will often work on a lab with your partner/group. You are expected to be fully enaged with the lab activity during class.\nIf you are in class and fully engaged with the lab, then you will receive full points for the lab assignment. You do not need to submit your work.\nIf you have an excused absence, then you will need to complete any class activities you missed within one week of your absence to receive credit. You can submit the completed activity to me via email or slack DM.\n\n\nHomework (20%)\nHomework assignments will be assigned almost every week and due on Fridays at 11:59 PM. The homework will consist of a mix of hand-written exercises, coding exercises, and essays. The purpose of the homework is so that you can demonstrate and grow your conceptual understanding of data science. Homework will be submitted as pdfs on Gradescope and will be graded for correctness, neatness, and clarity.\nLate Work Policy. You may turn in two of your homework assignments on the following Tuesday (instead of Friday). Please message me before the original due date if you plan to do this. If you find yourself struggling to meet deadlines outside these two times, then please reach out to me or your class dean so we can help.\n\n\nQuizzes (30%)\nThere will be four 30 minute quizzes throughout the semester. All quizzes will be taken during the last 30 minutes of class on Thursday, February 12, Thursday, March 5, Tuesday, April 7, and Thursday, April 23. These quizzes will be closed book and closed notes, though you will be allowed to bring one sheet of notes (front and back of an 8x11 piece of paper). If you cannot make a quiz, then please let me know ASAP so we can make alternate arrangements.\n\n\nExtra Credit Opportunity\nThroughout the course, you can earn up to a maximum of 6 extra credit points. These points can be added to your lowest quiz score. You can earn points through any of the following engagement activities:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) point for every question asked on the #questions Slack channel.\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) point for every question answered on the #questions Slack channel.\n1 point for every math, statistics, or data science talk you attend.\n2 points for participating in DataFest (April 17-19).\n1 points for completing the course evaluation.\n\nYou will keep track of your own extra credit points and let me know how many you earned at the end of the semester.\n\n\nProject (30%)\nThe class has a capstone final project where you will work with a partner to conduct and present an original data analysis on a dataset of your choice.\nThe aim of the project is for you to engage with a data science technique of your choice deeply. You can pick a technique we discussed in this class or choose one you want to learn about. There are many ways you can meaningfully engage with the technique. This may include applying the technique to a dataset, conduct a simulation study where you are comparing multiple methods, implement a new method from a paper, study an intricate proof, create a piece of artwork, etc. Be creative! Whatever you decide should be be challenging and expand your current skill set. (i.e., you can’t do a project you have already done or are currently working on.)\nThe project consists of the following components (in parentheses is weight of that component’s grade in the overall project grade):\n\nProposal Presentation (10%)\nExploratory Data Analysis or Preliminary Results (10%)\nPeer Review of Preliminary Analysis (10%)\nPresentation (30%)\nWebsite for Project (30%)\nGitHub Repository (10%)\n\nMore information will be provided about the project and the individual components later in the semester.\n\n\nFinal Assignment (5%)\nDuring finals week, you will work on a final assignment consisting of reflective questions."
